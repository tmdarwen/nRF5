Nordic nRF52840 Basic Project Template for Segger Embedded Studio
=================================================================

**Description**

This is a basic project template for the [Nordic nRF52840 Development Board](https://www.mouser.com/new/nordic-semiconductor/nordic-nRF52840-dev-kit/) using [Segger Embedded Studio](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/Segger-Embedded-Studio) and the [nRF5 SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Software/nRF5-SDK).

After loading the project in Embedded Studio, you'll need to update the "Global Macros" setting to add the NRF SDK location.  The global macros setting can be found by selecting the "Tools" pulldown menu, clcking "Building" and you'll see "Global Macros" under the "Build" section.  As an example, if you installed the nRF5 SDK at "C:\Nordic\nRF5SDK" you'll want to set the global macro as "NRFSDK="C:\Nordic\nRF5SDK".  After doing so, you should be able to build and run the basic project template.

The basic project template program simply displays "Hello World(n)" to a terminal program such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), where n starts at 0 and increments each time "Hello World" is printed.  "Hello World" will print once at startup and everytime a key is pressed in the terminal program.
